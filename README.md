# Rumor-spreading
Fortran & Python codes to simulate the [spreading of rumors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumor_spread_in_social_network).
This code was developed for the [Stochastic simulation methods](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/master/programme-syllabus/stochastic-simulation-methods/) subject imparted in the [Complex Systems master course](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/master/) from the [IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/es/).

The simulation is comprised by a Gillespie algorithm for a SIHR model (susceptible-infectious-hibernator-recovered), as introduced in [Zhao et al (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437111009058).
